# EXP_03
# Differential Amplifier

## Introduction
The differential amplifier is a crucial analog circuit that amplifies the difference between two input signals while rejecting common-mode signals, making it essential for applications requiring precise signal amplification and noise reduction; this experiment will investigate its key parameters, including differential-mode gain, common-mode gain, and CMRR, through practical measurements and analysis of a constructed circuit, thereby providing a hands-on understanding of its operational principles.

## Aim
To design a differential amplifier and perform the DC Analysis, Transient Analysis and AC Analysis and extract the required parameters for the following specifications.<br>
VDD=3.2V<br>
P<=2.8mW<br>
Vicm=1.6V<br>
Vocm=1.7V<br>
Vp=0.6V<br>

## Components Used:
1. M1 and M2 (CMOSN): These NMOS transistors form the heart of the amplifier, doing the actual amplification of the difference between the input signals.

2. VDD (2V): This DC power supply provides the energy for the circuit to operate and defines the voltage range the signals can swing within.

3. R1 and R2: These load resistors convert the amplified current from the transistors into the output voltage that we measure.

4. RSS: This tail resistor sets the bias current for the transistors, which is crucial for proper operation and influences the gain.

5. V2 and V3: These are the input voltage sources, providing the signals that the amplifier will take the difference.

## Procedure:

1.Open LTspice and import the tsmc018.lib file before building up the circuit.<br>
2.Make sure that the file must be in the same folder as the experiment file<br>
3.Use the (.t) option in the toolbar and type .lib tsmc018.lib to import the library of that file<br>
4.Select the Rd and Rs with accurate Values and Select NMOS4<br>
5.Rename the MOSFET's as CMOSN<br>
6.DC Analysis :To perform the DC analsyis select the Configure Analysis Option in toolbar and select 'DC op pnt'. Find the Id by adjusting the length and width of the CMOSN.<br>
7.Transient Analysis: To perform the Transient analsyis select the Configure Analysis Option in toolbar and select 'Transient' set the operating point such as Stop time 5ms find the Gain by finding out the Vin and Vout from the waveform.<br>
8.AC Analysis: To perform the AC analsyis we must select the Configure Analysis Option in toolbar and select AC analysis select the operating points like Type of sweep as decade, Number of points per decade as 20, Start and Stop Frequency from 0.1 to 1T Hz.<br>

## Design 
Iss = P/Vdd = 2.8mW/3.2V = 0.875mA<br>
Iss = 0.875mA<br>

ID1 = ID2 = Iss/2 = 0.875m/2 =0.4375mA<br>
ID = 0.4375mA <br>

RD = (VDD - Vocm)/ID<br> 
RD = (3.2-1.7)/0.4375m = 3.428kohm<br> 
RD = 3.428kohm<br>

Rss = Vp/Iss = 0.6/0.875mA = 685ohm<br>
Rss = 685ohm<br>

## DC Analysis 
DC analysis is done to ensure whether the mosfet operates in saturation region and to calculate the DC operationg point of the transistor. This prevents signal distortion, which helps in the determination of the biasing resistors.This helps in getting a correct operating point despite the fluctuation in the other parameters.

## Inference

Differential amplifiers are preferred because they offer *high stability, precision, and noise rejection. They ensure **consistent gain* and work well even with power or temperature changes. Their ability to reject *common-mode noise* makes them essential in *op-amps and signal processing*Â applications.
